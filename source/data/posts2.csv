"also forgor to mention i slept outside on our garden on a very uncomfortable bench but it was a way better sleep than my bed could ever give, also why does sleeping on meth feel way better than sober sleeping",Present

"Aww. Nah sober life isn't for me. I'm in too much pain for that. I don't take opiates, I don't actually use cocaine at this time, if I could ever find any, probably. All I got is occasional Adderall binges and Delta 8. Get off.",Present

"honestly wish i was given meth as a toddler. it was the first time rush that got me hooked you know, I bet if they gave it to me so young i would’ve forgot about it and it wouldn’t have hit the same. Bet i wouldn’t be addicted",Past
Also have to say I’m more thankful than ever for my sobriety today.

"Maybe consider methadone. You don’t get high like you do on oxy but if you take the same 45mg a day I doubt you get high anyways. 

You get way more pain relief from a dose of methadone IMO",Future
"Yes - My first opiate was a codeine 30mg, I'd tried every drug under the sun but somehow barely knew what an opiate even was, just something to stay away from. A girlfriend who had back pains kept nagging me to try it - I kept saying no knowing what I'm like, I obsess over a drug till I get bored and move on to the next - But I knew opiates were different.

In the end ""fuck it"" tried one, then two, then three - we split up and I had to find another way to feed this new thing I'd discovered. CWE, and smashed that for a couple years going up to 500mg - Grew my own poppies one year and smoked the sweet sap, found the all-round-high of pods to be nicer than codeine but another year or so till the nausea to high ratio was too much. Here I am 7 years after that first pill trying to get my shit together on a methadone program but have a side-bitch called H.",Past
"I actually laughed out loud at the loooooong line which goes sooooo far baaaack - 50-60 years/1-2 generations 😂😂😂

So you mean you take drugs sporadically, like not addicted, just so you can connect with people? Doesn't sound that bad to me. I mean social anxiety sucks for sure, but there are far worse illnesses, so all in all you're doing great!",Future
"Or you can quit it. That I've done and, while certainly a very shitty experience, it is no big deal. Physical withdrawal lasts about a week, the first three days are the worst part, then it gets easier. Psychological WD is very subjective, but having a job and a bunch of friends basically takes you through all the difficult parts. In a year or two you will be like new, no signs whatsoever of past drug use.",Past
"Yea im my head i hate the shit now , i do understand that tho im real head strong its just the physical symptoms that kill me bu thank you i know i can beat it",Present
Been ~450-500mg/day OxyContin tolerant from 2016-2017. So yeah. It’s very possible.,Past
Oh dude by the end I was losing it I was working 2 jobs day job was a delivery driver and by the end I was hallucinating shit in the mirrors on the truck while I was driving and shit my second job it’s like I had super hearing and I could hear everybody talking about how high I looked “they actually were well one guy was talking shit but I didn’t know wtf to do cause I was  actually high as shit and goin crazy” how I didn’t get fired idk man I know stores on my delivery route atleast one guy definitely knew something was up I hate uppers but that was the only way I could stay awake driving because I was working so much I could only sleep like 4 hours a night and I was just miserable,Past

"I would take 100mg and sleep 20 hours at a time lbs. you will feel empty with goose skin when you wake up, but when you take a warm shower and break fast with some light fruit, you will be A OK. Benzos and seroquel is a god send",Present
I’ve tried it I didn’t get addicted it feels pretty damn good but probably the only reason I haven’t is bc I don’t know any trustworthy plugs. If I could do it everyday I definitely would.,Present
I use to wonder why people used drugs I couldnt for the life of me understand why people would do something that would potentially hurt them. After 12 years and counting (Although here pretty soon I'll be slowing my roll with harder substances) I completely understand why people do drugs. Honestly I believe you should try anything (that wont kill you!) at least twice. Have fun my friend life is short enjoy it you wanna try something then please by all means try it dont let people scare you into missing out on something you're interested in. Do the research know and understand what it is you are getting yourself into an do it! Hope this is helpful to you and anybody else.,Past
Yeah I’ve done fent a few times before. It’s just a quick nod and no euphoria. Really strange because these lasted a solid 5+ hours from an oral dose and were definitely a euphoric “up” high as opposed to a straight nod.,Past
"I’m the same as the other commenter. Never think about my breathing but use how close I am to nodding to gauge how high I am. As an Oxy user, if I’m actually nodding, it’s likely to much. Oxy doesn’t give you the physical nod as easy as morphine or heroin but the euphoria is on another level. My aim is to get as high as I can before I start to nod",Future
"Hang in there. Felt the same way today. Woke my mom up just t say hi to her. Haven't been getting along with her for the sat few years and Im trying to take baby steps. Things are hard when you feel alone in the world. You can message me if you want to, just a listening ear to help a brother/sister out.",Past
"I've only been to rehab twice, but both times most of the opiate users were all younger.  I was in my mid-30's and there were a couple other opiate addicts my age, but the vast majority were 18-25.  The women older than me were all there for alcohol.",Past
"It should show in there tests idk how you got away with that one but also maybe they're only testing for the big 5(Meth, Coke, Opiates, Pot, and PCP) Idk why a 5 panel drug test includes PCP instead of Benzos but its a nice loophole I've always use to my advantage if I know the people testing me are gonna use a 5 panel. Thats what I got tested with at most of my jobs and actually one Court ordered drug class you can also use hallucigens without being caught that was my main go to during those times some good mushrooms and a few xanz for the come down(:",Past
I’m sorry that totally sucks. I’m realize how lucky I am to have my pain treated properly.,Present
"Again, I just mentioned what I took not what my tolerance was. I’m in a house with my family, I’m not intending to sit down and nod out. 90mg+ doses will get me there, I’m fine between 30-60mgs. Thanks for the concern though",Present
"That was prescribed to me 3 months ago. Same previous years of PM experience. No idea why I took the #20 tramadol pills when I know I have a bad reaction from SSRI based medications. Tried one 50mg, beyond mood disorders and anxiety for the next 12 hours..",Past
Surprised your withdrawing from 3 weeks of usage lol. How much were you taking? After the 72hour mark things start to look up from there. Usually by the fourth day mark you only have mild symptoms left. I’ve used the drugs for months at extremely high doses and have withdrawn many times; you’ll be okay. One time I kicked 130mg/day without anything it sucked but I rode it out,Past
If he is trying to get sober(some day ) even eventually he should try to not destroy his body with alcohol the rest is fine hope all is good I’m about in the same boat but getting clean/healthy through subs after surgery,Future
"Soooo...

Took your excellent advice but I really should have waited longer than 30.

You were kidding about strong!

At 30 minutes I felt nothin. So took another and holy CHRIST!

Some gogo juice is helping from completely nodding, but now I look like I'm in the late stages of cerebral palsy",Present
yea i think the biggest thing is not letting it develop into the obsession that it so easily can become. if you just use it as a tool then it can be managed like any other tool where you outweigh the benefits to the consequences,Future
"Meth is not easy to get off at all, you feen meth, you get a taste for it an thinking about having a puff you can literally water at the mouth.
Meth was a hard drug to get off for me anyhow an I find a lot of people relapse because it’s so easy to get back on.",Past
"It was going to happen sooner or later.  I believe things happen for a reason (not God; I'm an atheist).  I also don't believe in free will, at least not in any significant decisions -- getting addicted to opiates was always going to be part of my neurological profile.

For these reasons, it's unfortunate, but I'm not sure if I would use the word ""regret"".",Past
"No way jose. Its a great drug yeah its pretty addictive but if youve never tried it, how do you know.",Past
"I've personally avoided having any type of diagnosis attached to me. I do struggle to focus. but usually just smoke pot to get on with it, speeds tend to make me nervous. I dunno, It seems I'm able to use psychedelics, opiates, &amp; benzos differently than most.",Present
fent pills are harder to taper with bc u dnt kno what anoulge ur dealin with and there mostly short acting ones and are prly not equally distributed in those pills all these things make it alot harder to taper fent imo,Present
We’ve all said we’re never touching them again. Boredom is typically the culprit later on and that makes us think “one more time won’t hurt”. Just remember what this feeling is like and that one more time will turn into this all over again. You’re lucky to have good family who is willing to help you through it. I have faith in you man stay strong and good luck.,Past
I think what I'll do is take .5 sub at 40 hour mark see where that takes me wish me luck,Present
its really not that bad- i smoke weed daily on suboxone and it actually really helps me stay away from harder drugs. but w the drinking it sounds like he just replaced one addiction w another kind of,Present
"Opiates may be the only things on Earth that are truly ""too good"".",Present
Make sure your pupils are fully dilated. That’s how I always could tell and be safe.,Present
Yup never have I tried something in my life and instantly know that I was fucked,Present
So is it just one main high in the day you do it till you feel your point then more again that day and how much milligrams of oxy does it take and congrats man stay smart about how you dose,Future
"I don't know about anyone else, but when I'm getting high and feeling the warmth of euphoria,  the last thing I'm thinking about is my blood oxygen or whatever. Usually when oxy makes me feel sedation and causes me to nod I know I've had enough.",Present
if you don’t than you haven’t done them long enough. i will say it made me take addiction seriously when i use to think it was a joke or that it was for the weak. i am careful about anything i put in my body because i know all substance can be a problem,Past
"Yeah dude, guess metabolism has a huge role in how fast it passes.  Has to be more to it than just that, but it eludes me lol. Be careful out there",Present
"At this point I can take 8 30s at once (240mg) and not get any pupil constriction or anything. Shit blows. Although, I blew my tolerance up with Tianeptine. Stay away from that shit.",Present
Idk my days of using were hands down a more exciting time than my days of doing great in college,Past
"Exactly.  I'm at the point where I get 48 hours of (mild) withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours of indulging.  It's a terrible bargain, and as you said, it's too much of a hassle and too disruptive to my life.",Present
"What do you mean ""Unfortunately"" you don't do hard drugs anymore??! Dude being clean and having a good job with some debt is way better than OD'ng without Jack shit to show for your life. Give yourself some credit (no pun intended)",Present
"please don't do it, I promise you you'll regret every second and for the rest of your life if you're like most of us who have experienced heroin. stay strong my friend this is not the path to go down for many reasons",Future
"People always say this but to me it's akin to green tea with bitter undertones, not that bad. I have been taking it for over half a decade now so maybe I'm desensitized haha.",Present
"You’d need to swallow it. The whole point of the grapefruit juice is to inhibit certain enzymes in the stomach/intestines (forget which one), when u snort it doesn’t get digested in that route",Present
staying clean is a bitch. I can't even count all the relapses,Past
Stay clean if that’s too much get on methadone it changes lives really,Present
"Thanks man. I’ve taken 60mg and feel pretty toasty. Sorry to hear mate truly, I hope things get better for you. I appreciate your advice, I wasn’t planning to abuse it anyhow. 

I wish you all the best sir 🙏",Present
That’s true definitely will power. I don’t have access it’s a mission for me to get some so that’s a good thing when I wanna quit. That headache is prob from using. Opiates cause horrendous headaches that’s also another reason I want to quit,Past
"Go to suboxone or methodone for treatment if you have to. CPS is going to be on your ass for a while. Happy to hear you are ok, just lucky you where not alone. This is why I quit using, you can’t trust anyone anymore with what you are getting. Good luck to you.",Present
"It's happiness vs pleasure. I've been much happier, but it would be hard to say I've felt more pleasure.",Past
It takes 1 stressful day or something for me to just jump back on it and I hate that. I’ve got no will power. What mental part? What goes through your mild? U start missing the high?,Present
"I’d just let it filter through. I always did hydrocodone and never really used s cone shape.... makes a ton if sense if you dont want to make a mess, i reckon. I am not a smart 😔",Past
"Do you get bad physical withdrawals? Mine tend to subside too around the 4-5 day mark, but the mental part hits like a ton of bricks.",Present
I believe you can get clean. A lot of work ahead. But its worthy it. Prayers your way.,Future
"Happy, giddy energised. Straight A student. That’s me sober and I haven’t been for 4 years. Maximum I was sober for was for 2 weeks went overseas and the country I was in I could’ve got jail time with carrying any opiates. The day I came back was back on it",Past
Ya 25F lolll but I literally just posted that this will hopefully be my last I’m trying to quit 🥴,Present
"Fuck yea! Glad u were able to quit. 
Hopefully one day i can get off subutex all toghether.",Future
You can do it! I was taking that much oxy combined with some fent and tar. I am 19 months sober. We do recover.,Past
I promise you it would be a decision you will regret 100% stay strong I promise you have the ability and strength to find a way out. Don’t turn to drugs for any reason. They will become your worst enemy.,Past
I was on 4-5 OC80S whe. I switched to H bc I had finally found H that was pure and I could buy chips off the brick. From there tolerance only went up more and more. After I couldn’t take it anymore I went on Methadone,Past
"I get it now, I was under the impression that you wanted to get clean, than decided fuck it and got some more, or you were picking up more so you could detox with it, maybe get high one last time",Present
I got a pollywop and a couple tartzies for 8. After I spoop those willys I'ma be cloozed for a longin'.,Present
kick from street fentanyl in 5 days? when i went to rehab coming off this stuff i did a 5 day sub taper and felt like shit for weeks after,Past
"Been using since 2004-2005. I still get a rush when I IV, but I have tried to quit a few times which ended up me taking 6 month breaks before a relapse. 

After a long time you’ll definitely still feel it, unless you have super weak stuff. But it mostly just keeps you functioning",Past
Quitting was only way my sex life got back to normal. Beware tho it will take a little time to get your stamina back if you do quit. Good luck my friend,Past
I love morphine.  U have to shave it up and put powder in a 3ml oral syringe and plug it.   45-70mg I prefer over dope,Present
"Sorry for your loss. Opiate withdrawal is incomprehensible to describe... the hardest part is about getting clean is staying clean, especially the boredom and a general apathy. I wish I could wake up like normal people and NOT feel like I need a shot...

Thank you for sharing.",Future
"Like I said a month will be tough, but not as painful as a heavy year+ user. And if you can find some red kratom strains. They will take the edge off.


Don’t get any deeper than you are. You will regret it, I’ve been obsessed with this shit for 15 years now.",Past
Alright cool I appreciate the advice Ive never had much trouble quitting drug habits in the past but i know heroin is a different monster,Past
"I’m sorry it didn’t work for you. I’m a pretty big advocate for it, but I guess there is no cure all for a topic as nebulous as addiction.


Now that my tolerance isn’t up high from fent cut heroin, I usually get a decent buzz like taking a few hydrocodones",Present
Kratom tastes super disgusting so I’d recommend the capsules. yeah it’s wayyyy more expensive but they’re many times easier than trying to choke down that dogshit,Present
"Kratom is an amazing plant and back when I was clean, it was a large part of the reason I was doing as well as I was.

Some people are just ignorant and don’t want to learn unfortunately.

Red strains once you lose a bit of your former dope tolerance feel like a nice buzz",Past
nah he will end up regretting it later on down the road trust me. subs ain’t nothing to play with. only harder opioid that’s more difficult to come off of is methadone,Past
"thanks man, clean from fentanyl and opiates now for about a week. hope you are well too!",Present
He can do whatever he wants.  I'd rather take 1 or 2mg of suboxone than try to take down 10-20g's of Kratom a day maybe even multiple times a day.  At least its prescribed and has a long half life.,Future
I’ve had that shot before and tried to shoot up even though people specifically told me “you won’t get high”. I was stubborn and kept trying and eventually gave up because I was wasting my dope. ,Past
"All good to know, I mean I wont have the issue of resisting the drug cause if I stop buying it then I wont be around it anymore. Anyway thanks man",Past
i used many kinds of opioids and never felt itchy from them. they release histamine which is why you feel itchy but it doesn’t affect me which is weird since i get allergies bad so i would think it would affect me but it hasn’t.,Present
"Opiates IV'ed dont give me a head rush anymore, it's like a sore ache that creeps up my spine into my neck.  Kinda like a headache actually, but nice.",Present
"Yea I've tapered off a few drugs before, just curious how much most people reduce it by every day, I was thinking halve the dose every day.",Past
"It's not like I buy $10 bags at a time, I plan further ahead than that so it's the same batch. Anyway I'll taper off and let ya know how it goes",Future
"I see what you're saying but I know myself pretty well and I have more self control than that. I've quit other drugs before and tapering works for me, kinda suck that nobody gave any advice on how to do it. Guess I'll figure it out myself",Past
"I buy 5 grams at a time so it's the same batch, and tapering has worked for every other drug addiction I've quit. I'll let ya know when I'm done.",Future
"I've heard of that before I think, I'm only gonna be in withdrawals for a few days so I'll just taper with what I have. Last time I had to go through withdrawls I wasn't even puking do I don't think itll be too bad",Future
"Yeeeeaaahhh but it’s accountability. 

I feel like relapsing and not acknowledging it would come from a place of fear and shame for me. Own it and grow from it.

You do you n shit, I’m glad you only dipped in and dipped out.",Future
I'm on 125mg twice a day. As far as opiates go its been a horrible pain killer for me.,Present
I'm on methadone it definitely doesn't work well for me.,Present
"I assumed it would start the clock all over again. Do you think it would make it any worse? I just have no real experience with wds, my girl and I have been pretty successful chippers going on a few years now.",Present
For me paws always hits around week 3-4 and lasts a week or 2 then its gone. The physical wd is 10x harder imo. No comparison to not sleeping for days at a time sweating and skin crawling. Paws is more mental than anything. If you lay around and do nothing it makes it worse.,Past
At least your not bullshiting yourself and saying you'll stay clean. Rehab is always a great place to meet like minded people. I always left rehab with several leads on new plugs.,Present
Should I do all ? I was planning on chewing them. Might bang one if I can get some info. I usually bang 135mgs of methadone daily. Bug last time I dosed was yesterday.  Really wanting a nice nod. Is chewing the way to go? If so whole thing? Or all 3?,Present
"hey mate, dont worry. i have quite the tolerance. have been a daily IV user since 2 years ago. small breaks every few months.",Present
Was 80mg of hydro the highest you got in dosage? And did you work up to 70mg of Methadone because that's quite a bit. My tolerance is 300mg of Oxycodone a day and 30-40 mg of Methadone gets me floored high.,Present
Ayy way to fuckkng go! I'll be three months sober on January 11th! Keep it up!!,Future
I’m just tired I’ve only slept a few hours and cried like a crazy woman when I close my eyes and rest it goes back to normal it feels like that when I do exertion I’ll gonna go to a family doctor no insurance don’t really wanna rack up a bill,Present
"I smoke all mine, higher chance of OD if you snort I would think",Present
Ooohhhh yesssss they do! And when you're a daily heroin user you can go a very long time without pooping. It can even get dangerous. Imagine dying from being unable to poop. But after a couple weeks the cramps I get are so severe. It's insane.,Past
I’ve heard shit about bowel movements and opioids so I thought it made him constipated and he finally took a shit or something lol. I don’t think opioids make you constipated though. Idk though I don’t use them that much.,Present
That's pretty reassuring fuck h.  Dilaudid is the way of the future!,Future
I did this and pupils were huge. Opiates totally canceled out,Present
You should feel good asf but benzos ruin the euphoria,Present
Injection of heroin is extremely bad especially continued use. It can ruin your veins and lungs and heart,Present
Dialudid was the happiest moment of my short life.  Sottimg there waiting for my next dose was he'll but when that nurse came i was overwhelmed with pure bliss pure ecstasy.... I've been chasing that ever since with oxy,Past
If you have no tolerance and use sporadically you should not be shooting. Snort or smoke for your safety,Present
Diazepam is basically my favorite drug of all time barring opiates. One of the few things I might do given the chance.,Future
"Morphine completely keeps me from reaching REM sleep, I have to lay off it, or gain a tolerance or I do not sleep. This is very much the same thing I think",Present
"I know man, and I feel bad for those people. I'm not tryna say I have it worse.",Present
How did it go?  Were you successful?  I have a habit very similar to yours and am also on east coast so prob the same product.  I want to try to microdose to induct suboxone as well.  Just wondering if it worked out for you?,Present
"I’m sorry mate but If I never touched opiates I’d be living a lot longer than I expect to. That maybe personal experience talking but that’s my reality, maybe not everyones, but it’s mine. Once again appreciate the comment though.",Past
"Thank you sir, I know of the risks with acetaminophen. I have not done opiates in years before this encounter yesterday, do you think I’d feel anything if I were to take some tonight?",Present
I’ve tried tons of different pills over the past 8 years sadly I just don’t like them 😭 like I said they make me physically sick. Like 90 pounds with no immune system type sick.,Past
I was on subs for 2 years at 24mg then methadone for the last 11 years at 145mg. I used while on subs but I would usually have to take a day or two off and really go hard on the dope to feel anything.,Past
"I'm not on opiates anymore but fuck with adderall, just so I can at least stay sane. Definitely searched my house 6 times today while praying to Junkie Jesus but he turned his back on me. :(",Past
Unfortunately I think you need to be actually tripping for your pupils to dilate.,Present
"This is some real shit. I think a vast majority of us feel that way. May not be actively suicidal but we keep seeing how close we can get to the edge. We nay not be trying to kill ourselves, but if it happens, it happens",Present
"thankyou for the concern i always give the same advice. but i smoked a small piece and am feeling pretty good, nowhere near as good as roxys tho imo",Present
"Prescription decrease does not decrease addiction issues. It increases them. If I can’t get my morphine, and I NEED it, then what street drug can I get that’s closest....Smack",Present
I’m on 3 antidepressants and I take kratom 3 times per day. Hasn’t caused any issues yet but not to say it couldn’t.,Present
I went 2 months clean and relapsed on fent and it was all bad very quickly. Best of luck.,Present
"I’ve snored dillies...I get oxymorphone though and that’s the god opiate if you don’t shoot, which I dont. Snorting dillies, especially 8mg ones is a great high. Take it easy on em though",Present
I used to smoke and IV but I wasn't clean in a week EVER. Sometimes it's analogs.,Past
I was snorting 30s 3 to 4 days before my probation test and it never showed up,Past
"Makes sense. That's actually nuts. I was confused when I was still high the whole next day, so this means you can just dose a large amount to save redosing?",Present
"15mg lol

I used to buy off the street *a lot* (for me anyway) for a couple of years, but then I was prescribed 10mg Percocet 3x/day from 2016-2017ish. After about six months, I started getting sick as hell from it (and pretty much every other opioid) at just about any dose.",Past
"I quit dihidrocodeine with codeine, but codeine has way smoother withdrawal and doesn't feel good to me when im used to dhc, just gives me headache. Tramadol has really bad withdrawals, plus it's very different than oxy so I'm not sure it would be a good idea.",Past
You dont need to feel guilt or shame. You turned that stuff down. Good job. You're still early in the ballgame. Cravings are normal and natural. They'll get better.,Past
"You can do it. Once you do and come out of it, you'll be a stronger person for it. Ask me how I know. 

Focus on a goal for motivation. You said you're going to see your parents for the holidays. That's a huge goal to strive for. Do you want to be yourself when you see them? I suspect I know the answer. Try to block out everything else and focus on that, mind over matter.",Future
"hey there,  I've been reading this post and it's been giving me hope that my man and I can kick H. we hate it and dont wanna do this anymore we have so much to live for and this isnt the way to live at all this shit sucks, I cant even by xmas gifts for my family.",Future
"Hang in there I remember day 8.  The lack of sleep during my first two weeks is disturbing to me hahah. Once I started getting  a bit more sleep I felt tons better. So thats something to look forward to in your near future. Thinking of the gains, what motivates me, and the why really puts things in perspective. What helps you get through it?",Future
"I never had any luck getting high with those. The name ‘darvocet’ just sounds amazing and you would think they have huge potential for a good buzz. Ultimately, it was a total let down for me, each and every time I tried (and I tried hard). Are they the big pink oblong ones?",Present
"Have spoken with Tracey. She is cool! 

I've never done h. Just pills and fent patches. Thought about switching. But after having seen this. Decided against ever doing h.  Hell, even managed to gain a little control over my addiction and have been doing a bit better.",Past
"320mg, i didnt have more at the same time.. no way near puking tho 😬 been on opioids 1.5 years",Past
"I wouldn’t go past 2 weeks of use, make sure to take little breaks, or you risk withdrawal",Present
"Thanks, ya mentally feeling better. Just woke up, my stomach is a little queezy rn, I’ll see how it goes through the day. Yesterday, day 6, my stomach still hurt like hell . Just RLS and stomach pains rn",Present
"Fair enough, I’ve always kind of considered the point you’ve certainly gone too far being the point when you have to take it to feel normal",Present
"Ah cool man, good times they are Oxy, up to you but I'd just take them orally. Everyone is different, I always find snorting anything really plays havoc with my sinuses. Enjoy ✌️",Present
"I tested it with marquis test and they tested oxy, I was scared they were fent",Present
Rlly? I feel like i was extra emotional on opiates.. like my gf broke up with me whom i loved dearly and i was sobbing crying freaking out while on them.. and then when good things happened i was jumping up and down with joy,Past
Oh I'm aware I don't actually eat that many percocet,Present
Not sure but I will say they are a waste of time really. To me they are not as strong as even tramadol,Present
I think his point is that it’s not the drugs itself that cause the addiction; it’s the resulting social isolation that causes problems. Not that I agree with that but it’s not that black and white.,Future
"er I've not quit, well I quit the H after 12 years in 1991, then had 25 years on methadone with a very occassional hit of H, now I'm on er morphine after a bad spinal injury. It's been 41 years in total.",Past
"Very well on the whole, thanks! :O) for the first few weeks after I started on the TRT I had permanently erect nipples and often spontaneously in other places too.  Also those 'special' dreams where you wake up and go eeeyyeeeeww! lol.  It was kind of my 2nd adolescence lol",Present
I wish this were the case. I wish I had endless supplies of all the drugs. I’d like to believe if I did I’d get my full then return to a life of moderation.  But none of that is realistic for me.,Past
I wish I could but I just ran out. I had one dose left and instead of doing the smart thing taking it tomorrow to stay better longer I did it to get higher,Past
Hoping I can push it to the back end of that timeline. Would be great if I could give myself a solid 10 days or so,Future
"If I were you I would use the remaining substance to do an aggressive tapering. With your moderate tolerance, this would save you the horrible second day.",Future
"Getting sober is the easy part, staying sober is the part most people fail at. It's takes a storm to test you, when you're sober and experience a big L, that's when the true test begins. Not relapsing, that takes strength and will power. You got this! Fuck the shit out of 2021!",Present
benadryl (diphenhydramine) is INCREDIBLY easy to get a hold of. and also being sober and having my brain be able to think makes me feel bad so,Present
"if you don’t metabolize it well, trams are ass. trams are 1/10 oral morphine, so if you didn’t get that high off 200mg LAST NIGHT, you probably won’t have much luck w 300mg.",Present
Im not sure abt canada but in the states ive never heard of a 45 mg oxy. There is a 40 mg thats yellow but either way ive never known anybody to take between 1000 and 2500 mgs of oxy per day..are u sure that he is doing his math right?,Present
"I took some xans with oxy and next thing I remember I’m in hospital, don’t fuck with it no matter the dose imo",Past
If u are dead set on takin the oxys then save em for tomorrow when u aint on the xans and the booze,Present
U really shouldnt mix em with xans if u dont have a tolerance.,Present
A relapse? So youve been addicted to these before and u dont know what your body can handle? Stick to the smirnoff bro and send those k57s to me. Cool?,Past
You can do this. It ain’t no walk in the park but you’ll get through it. I’ve been off opioids since 2018 after at least 5 years of using them. I’m rooting for you!,Past
You are missing the point. You need sobriety during therapy because without you are clouding your ability to focus on fixing yourself.,Present
My best friend ended up in the hospital twice after writing cold turkey. Heroin WD are a nightmare.,Present
Probably alcohol in 2014 was going through a very rough time and almost died from alcohol withdrawals because I ain’t have insurance,Past
When I withdrawal my most severe symptom is vomiting by far. It happens every single time and that’s the worst part. All those meds can be helpful but they’re prescription meds and my goal was never to become “Clean.”,Past
I tried to quit with benzos probably 50+ times and it never ever worked but whatever works for who ever else good for em,Past
It's true. It's scary the level we rely on doctors to do the right thing for us when many of them are inept or just don't care. I'm not sure if I'd been that early in my recovery I'd have been able to be as strong as OP here and for that I commend them greatly.,Past
"Well, the good news it’s been only three months. But never the less, going cold turkey will be extremely harsh. The way I used to handle this, was get my hand on a few subs and taper off. It worked great for me. Sorry, but that’s the best advise I can come up with.",Past
"Thanks for this. I’m only 8 days and feel in the worst sort of mental hell. As you say, I need to constantly ask myself what I want. Thanks mate. Keep strong, you’re doing great btw",Present
God thank F it’s not just me. It actually feels painful to simply exist. I have every physical/material need met but the sheer mental/emotional pain is bloody hectic.,Present
I am on day 8 as well and the mood swings are insane. I thought I was going crazy.,Present
"That is awesome! I met my husband in active addiction. We are now both over 3 years clean. Everyone said we would never make it because we used together, wr beat the odds so far. Im so happy for you &amp; your wife!",Past
Thank you I'm trying I haven't done shit in 7 months there are know meetings so it's hard to get support,Present
"Well by day 11 I will have no benzos left (im just using what I have stocked up on for a withdrawal ) and I'm prescribed 225mg of pregabblin a day, and I'm planning to taper that aswell before I tell the doc

I'm trying to come off herion, and this is my plan.",Future
"Yep I go from 20 bag to whole paycheck in about a two week timeframe from my last relapse, which was when the stimulus went out (guess where my stimulus went)",Present
"I'm no expert but I mostly hear about withdrawals from long-term use, but maybe like opiates they start faster if you've been addicted before? Either way probably best to knock them off soon",Future
"I don't think so personally, maybe some minor anxiety after a week. Just half the dose a couple times before ya stop should be ok",Present
"Very similar situation. Back pain, family. They gave me such a boost. I was a golden child, didnt drink till just before I was 18. Didn't smoke till I was 20. Ive never done drugs it just helped me feel like me. It's too late before you're already an addict.",Past
"Thanks for sharing your personal journey with us all. Unfortunately, addiction happens in a blink of an eye. My story is similar but started after a surgery and being prescribed opiates. I am so proud of the both of you. Stay strong and carry on. Congrats.",Past
7 800mg pills. Before I got clean I was up to 15 800mg daily. 7 soma pills a day 1 week outta the month and 2 weeks outta the month up to 300mg of tramadol. But was pretty consistent with the gabapentin. Withdrawal was a MONSTER as you can imagine.,Past
I’ve attempted suicide multiple times but somehow I always get brought back or someone finds me even when I do it by myself. It’s actually quite frustrating I just wish I could go peacefully so I didn’t have to endure this hell. fuck it I guess I was meant to suffer,Past
"Nothing I could ever say would take your pain away, I just wanted to let you know I read your story and greatly admire your strength. I hope you keep on fighting, if you can't for yourself, then for the memory of your daughter.",Future
i listen to podcasts and have started painting. if you’re several months in you want to consider your lack of motivation may be because you are depressed? you could talk to your doctor about that,Past
"That's everything I was taking during active addition, then I was clean 5 months ( the withdrawals were horrid) I cant believe I did this to myself. I should've just try to deal with the emotions in another way ugh",Past
"I relapsed on tramadol (150mg) which I have stopped a few days ago, soma (300mg) which I stopped a week ago, and now currently taking gaba (6,000 mg) for about 4 days now.",Past
"I used to think it would never get better. That the cravings would never subside. 
I will have 4 years clean in April, and I can finally say I don’t crave dope anymore. I can’t remember when it stopped but it finally did. 
Stick with it
I’m proud of all of you!",Past
"I actually failed out of university bc of it almost 10 years ago now and still suffer continual consequences to this day. Take it from me, get out of it while ya can bc this shit will eventually take away everything good from your life.",Past
"Long time booze hound opiate addict, that drank through withdrawals. In my experience it will not extend the opiate withdrawal symptoms, but you'll definitely feel way worse.",Past
"It was the last symptom to go when I detoxed. I sneezed for months. And now, three and a half years later I still never only sneeze once when I do happen to sneeze, it’s always sneezing fits now.",Past
"Can only tell for myself.It didn't completely resetted my wd as i took a tiny amount of fent during detox, but it felt like i was throwed back one or two days.",Past
i know about it. just cant afford 9 days worth of fent. plus my girl uses too so thats double what i would need for 9 days of dope so we could both get off,Present
"TBH When I get clean I have so much energy, I feel well again and happy I don't have to worry about gear.

With a habit, I'll feel high for 6 hours, then sick again until I can redose.  Going through that every day sucks,  you can even sometimes get sick of the buzz.",Future
I used to feel exactly the same way and the only thing that helps is racking up more clean time. You’ll get less cravings and self destructive thoughts as time goes on. I only just started feeling “normal” at 100 days and now have about 240 days.,Future
"Hell yeah, ur in the final stretch. I permanently fucked up my sneeze game, like i can never sneeze only once, it's always a total fit of em. Addiction, the gift that keeps on giving.ive been off em 2 years",Past
True. If I can get rid of the restlessness I can get through the withdrawals.,Future
"today i have 22 days clean. i did alllllll the laundry and painted my nails and cooked a meal. tomorrow i might organize my closet. i’ve also been trying to do a 20 min walk every day and yoga, though i really need to learn new poses.",Present
No sweat my man....I never ever thought I would get clean but I did it and I don’t even think about opiates anymore,Past
I recently got clean....I was OD’ing every week and enough was enough....got on suboxone and I’m getting my life back....,Past
98 days clean and My life is drastically better man! It’s crazy what being clean can help you accomplish,Past
"If I relapse, how do I move past it, I’m so scared.",Present
that is amazing. i can’t even tell my real sister because she’s very judgmental about opiates. i don’t blame her. her close friend od’d and died in her bathroom. it’s just a burden i can’t put on her. but i have a close friend who understands,Present
" wait 36-48 hours if not more! I thought I was fine after a day and a half, I was a heavy fent user like you, took my sub and got the WORST precipitated withdrawals of my life death was preferable! I felt I was gonna seize out just please wait it out 😔",Past
Yes that's why I'm so frustrated with myself that I picked methadone of all things ... But I'm going to get through it. I have to  jd,Future
"that’s amazing, congrats! this is the first time in like 10 years i can get my family presents as well. it’s not much, but still. feels fucking crazy.",Past
"I appreciate all the advice, thank you.

I will try to pull through without the benzos. Problem is I take care of a pregnant wife due in a month and two elderly parents, the withdrawals can’t interfere with my ability to function.",Present
"I understand you’re well intended, but this simply isn’t true. I’ve done a line of real H, and took 4 mg 6 hours later. No adverse effect. If the subs are in your system enough and you use a full agonist, you will not go into PWD.",Present
I think all addicts are. I think the reason we fall into drugs is partly because of that: we don't see a directive or a thing to get passionate about. People who recover usually always get into working out or some hobby.,Present
"Honestly benzos would make me say screw it and relapse , just stay clean bro",Present
You'll be alright. Been on subs ages. Just used one bag? Have a sleep. Then take it as normal the next day. You'll be fine. I do it all the time. The only time I get PWD is if I've been on a week binge. You had one bag for one day. You'll be fine. I promise.,Present
I’m normally on subutex and I’ve used grams and taken a subutex the next day and been fine. I just wanted to make sure I would’ve been good w suboxone bc I’m not familiar with it. I just switched,Present
I always found having a shower helped with the scalp itching. Codeine would always give me bad itching. Morphine itching I find rather pleasant.,Present
"16 mgs is quite a bit. Cut it now before it gets too bad, believe me. Taper for the next month or so and then use kratom for another 1-2 weeks and then jump off. Good luck.",Future
I have methadone though so I’m pretty numb 24/7 regardless.,Present
Fent got rid of all my problems while using but then I regretted doing it and got hit with a brick of emotions when I quit worst idea I’ve ever had temporary relief was not worth it when I could have dealt with it and came to terms with my issues instead of prolonging Them,Past
"I had the same thing once in the states, a looong time ago. They're horribly stingy now. What'd they give out dilly syrup for?",Past
"Doing a little better, and yes they know of what brought me here. Thru just gave me some hydroxyzine and I'm bouta get discharged.",Present
Strange I did 3 days in a row and stopped today have no withdrawals.,Present
"Gabapentin and tramadol worked wonders. The tramadol didn't reset the withdrawals at all for some reason, so it'll work with a T break",Present
Jesus I’m dealing with it now LOL was gonna write this same thing. Kind of annoying but only happens when I’m really out of it. Just kind of annoying I guess.,Present
"My pupils are so pinned... it's only for the holidays tho, opposite of what you're doing. Acid and weed will be amazing... you know psychedelics will help reset your addiction? Maybe it's a good time to stop and try something else this coming year",Present
I’m an hour past day 5 and just know THAT IT DOES GET BETTER. Cheers to a sober 2k21,Future
My gf has never figured out. Even when time when I get really dizzy and collapsed I talked my way out of it somehow. Y’all ever get that? Like spinners and you can’t stand up?,Past
"Thanks. Will definitely go and buy all of that! 
I can deal with the mental side effects, it’s the physical ones I guess I was more concerned with. Thank you thank you",Future
"Yes most ppl I’d imagine, bcos I’ve been addicted to DHC I’m lovely and motivated on it but also can go from empathic to snappy quite quickly at times",Past

I have been on MMT for 22 years and successfully have stayed clean from heroin and mexis for less time but awhile.,Past
"I honestly enjoyed it, it made getting the tattoo a more enjoyable experience since I was off oxy the entire 8 hours. I also used some pain numbing gel at the same time. Took like 80 mg over that time",Past
Holy shit 5-8 a day that fent is unbelievable how fast your tolerance goes up. I’m just glad I realized before it got there. Literally the most I will ever do from now on is a half as a dose and try to make it smaller and smaller over the days. What do u think about that?,Present
Ive been an addict mate and noone cares. All i cared about was my next hit.,Present
"L-to the-O-L.  Assuming I hit a nerve.  8 months of an addiction doesn’t mean a lifetime of addiction.  I appreciate the emotion behind your comments. You are coming from a true place, I believe that.",Past
I see. I just have to constantly remind myself when I’m deep in wd that things will eventually get better. It’s such a strong mind game,Future
"Well I never keep one, I stop before I get too deep and I keep at least 10 days off before I start up with fent etc",Future
Didn’t cop tbh plug gave it to me. I am sure I am ready bro trust me it’s just I was doing 2 a day bro so it’s harder than it sounds. And when you are drenched in sweat and can’t stop moving ur legs u know what I mean. I’ve never been thru this before,Past
No switching back to Kratom in the morning so I should be okay I think. Got a large dose set out waiting for me,Present
"Well I reckon on day three I do notice if I listen to music and have a dance (even though I sweat, and the bath after that makes me also feel better) I do notice it helps. But on day one and two forget it! Lol. I  can't even get up for a glass of water.",Past
"I should add I’ve been using for about 6 years and my habit is 2 bundles a day of heroin/fent, sometimes more. I’m not sure what that breaks down to in other regions. I live near the biggest open air market if that gives someone a sense of the area I live in.",Present
"Thank you! Spot on about the mental aspect. Currently in a rough spot in my marriage and that's the main reason I need to quit. So I can step out of the fog and think clearly, making rational decisions.",Future
"Good shit man. 72 days from fent myself today. Take care of yourself, keep the post acute withdrawals in mind whenever you’re having an off day. All love and good luck.",Present
"Hey guys! Thank you for your help. I am from this day 130 days opiate free :) now Valium and dealing with underlying anxiety is next.
Thanks again:)",Present
I quit vaping nicotine the same time I kicked opiates. It just felt gross when I wasn’t high AF. I could never understand how people chain-smoked actual cigs during withdrawal or in the early clean stages..,Present

Amen had my last relapse in September and have been sober ever since.  First time actually committing.  That’s how bad it was.,Present
I always regret relapsing. We need to stop forgetting what WD feels like and how shitty drug addiction is. All we think about in that moment is the high not the consequences. I hate it. Praying Im able to get clean again. Im never relapsing again after this.,Future

You’re right I haven’t been 100% comfortable but it’s def helped. Today is day three and I’m hoping to cut back on the meds tomorrow. Congratulations on day 7 that’s HUGE!!! Seriously that’s amazing! I hope you sleep tonight and it just keeps getting better!,Present

So much better now thank you! Feeling nearly normal. Still get a bit achey and can’t stop eating. Tomorrow morning will be one week clean again! I’m going to start working on my plan to avoid taking them ever again xxx,Future

"I also realize now, that I’ve been through withdrawals many times I just didn’t know it was withdrawals",Past
I think the fact that so much is going on in the world that I can’t control helped. This addiction was something I could control if I really wanted to.,Present
"I hate to say it, but with subs its really a long process to get free from it. It's going to take some time to feel normal again.",Future
I second this. Coming down off a long acting opioid like subs or methadone is worse than what you're feeling right now.,Present
I don’t know what’s worst withdrawals or the depression I feel,Present
"I'm down to 2mg a day from 36. My doctors opinion is that within 3 days the sub will be knocked off the receptors and nullified. My doc has been great in regards to helping me taper and not giving into my bs in the beginning. I trust him, but also haven't heard of this route",Present
Wish I woulda jumped while I was on oxy had a worse habit but it turned into fent before I even knew it then went down a rabbit hole,Past
"Yeah I think about doing cool shit all the time and I know one day that will be possible and that’s kinda what keeps me going, I just haven’t had the chance to enjoy anything yet. Maybe I’ll hit the lottery one day lol",Future
Thanks man I relapsed twice oxy was my choice but I’m still fighting man it’s crazy but waking up not being dopesick and actually feeling every thing is a high in it self,Present

Do you think a month of use is going to give me full blow withdrawals? I’m so scared but I need to do it,Future
"If you can go to a detox for 5-7 days that’s the best I can tell you. I quit a million times on my own by tapering with oxy, subs, methadone, Kratom, cold turkey more than anything. But fentanyl is another animal dude. I wish you the best &lt;3",Past
I’d say it could be between 4-7 days. Last time I got clean I didn’t sleep for 6.,Past
This time I’m taking it serious so I can have the life I want,Future
I have been on that dose for 5-6 days. Trough opiate withdrawl. Was planing on stoping today. Meaning not gonna use them after,Future

"First time, I've done almost every drug once, but I've never gone through withdrawal. I don't like coke, hate meth, love heroin but hate needles, so I go to pills",Present
Do you think it helped rather than jumping off from the start? I know it will be painful either way but I think I might not do it just so I can avoid felling shitty for longer and get the acute withdrawals over with.,Future
I tapered off pressies and was using every two hours to the point I’d wake up at night drenched needing to use. I would use about midnight and wait 12-16 hours to use and then only enough at night to sleep and enough at the 12-16 hour mark to sit still.,Past
"It was never like, fuck it I’m going to lie to be spiteful it was like “fuck I wish I could be honest but I don’t want to burden them, and I just want to use”",Past
I’m on day 7 tram wds. I had a few drinks last night. Tbh it found didn’t have much of an affect. I don’t know if it’s because I feel so wired and restless without the pills? I don’t feel so great today tho,Present
"I wasn’t addicted to the tramadol I was taking them for an injury, I have 0 cravings and I’ve never had issues with addiction which I’m incredibly grateful for.",Past
"I don't like to drink more than that as I'm very susceptible to headaches when I'm withdrawing, and obviously don't have access to my usual way of dealing with them...",Present
Well my last day doing drugs I ended up in the emergency room. Got put on a nebulizer. My oxygen was at like 40% of normal. It was not good to say the least. I have a very good life now and I am constantly grateful for what I have.,Past
I never go cold turkey anymore. I always have a half or quarter dose to have on the third day. It gives me something to work towards as a reward and also I find the WDs are nowhere near as and after that. The real hard work starts when it wears off,Present
"Hi, 
I experienced this when I had withdrawals (twice) earlier this year, feels like something is trying to crawl out of your chest. Not sure how normal it is though😭",Present
"I feel, I’ve been clean for 2 months now and I’m always in a bad mood always upset. Just feels like I was happier on them than off",Past
"I counted about 42 days and then it just seemed to drain out real quick. But yeah, 42 days of wondering whether I would ever feel normal again.",Future
"Yes. I quit oxys and lost like 15 lbs (down to like 115/120, for context). The positive news is that I stayed smaller, mostly because I'm actually active and have time and money to eat real food.",Past
My appetite hasn’t changed. Nothing has changed except I’ve cut my use in half. That’s the only thing I can think of that broke my stall.,Present
I drink water like a mofo when detoxing. Like a glass an hour. I was/am constantly pissing in the bathroom.,Present

"If was for 6 years, I loved Heroin and I started back a bit back when my mother got Cancer",Past

"Just know you can do it. Im using red kratom, go get some. Im on day 3 of Cold turkey, and i feel like shit but the kratom helps SO much. And i feel AMAZING knowing im leaving this bullshit behind me. You CAN do it",Present
I am now at 120 days and doing great! Got through the anger stage. Very similar to drug scoring days. Rush and release. Now just recovering relationships and getting my new life in order. But life is awesome now that I've broken the bondage of opiates!!!!,Present
"I can't tell you how many times I made it to 5-7days only to finally start feeling better, say ""one more time"", and then slung right back into the full blown addiction.  Keep on pushing, you're on the right side of the fence right now.",Past
"I'm in the same boat. Just took sub after a while of using and I'm just as sick, possible PWD coming on. My heart is beating so fast. Time is our only friend.",Present
I am 48 hours in to no subs and feel like I am getting better still feel goofy hot cold numb anxious restless but it’s improving I think is this just cuz the subs haven’t entirely worn off or is it possible that I am on the upswing,Present
"I had one.  It reduced my WD. It was not a miracle cure. But I was able to eat for the first time in days when I got it placed. Mine was free, while it was still experimental.",Past
What can I do to cope? Would drinking help? Smoking weed? Aside from those things I only have about 300mg of tramadol left and saving it as long as I can,Present
"Hey I'm willing to try just about anything at this point. I've been prescribed subs in the past, I agree you about the low dose.",Present
"I’m not excited for withdrawals, but I’m excited to read this! I have edibles and benzos so it sounds like I’ll have a smooth landing.",Future
I used strong edibles to quit made from indica dominant strains. I found they completely eliminated my cravings and some of the acute effects as well. I made it almost two and half years clean before having a one time slip up. I haven't touched anything since.,Past
"I’ve been clean a while now but I’ve taken the ER route several times and it’s never come up anywhere else on any record especially if you don’t have insurance. The only ones who will have that record are that particular hospital but it’s up to you, just offering options",Present
It sounds like it would be super triggering for me (shooting up) but I'll check it out and see how far I can get through it!,Future
Day 20 for me! I’m hoping to try getting pregnant this spring. Congratulations and enjoy those muffins!,Future
"Thanks, yeah I’m torn between like, looking at it as a warm escape where everything’s okay but I also know it just makes the same reality a little bit more bearable, but it’ll all gonna be worse. Idk, thank you",Future
"i found it a little after rehab and finding out 2 guys i was with died, it hits me too hard at times",Past

Thank you for the advice and encouragement. It helps so much",Future
"I have one micro-dose psilocybin cap that I've been too anxious to take. I'm still yawning and sneezing so once those symptoms go away, I'm def going to try it because from past experience AND the research coming out - yeah. Big fan. Natural psychoactives FTW.",Past
I measure success with what I do have rather than where I’m going to be or want to be. I can’t control the future but I can control what I do with what I have now.,Future
Thank you. I know this is what i have to tell myself. And yea i want to be back on the horse so badly. I let myself make too many excuses the last month. Unfortunately i have had mild withdrawal the last two days that is finally tapering off. Should get some sleep tonight.,Future
"You’ve come this far, keep pushing thru. I’m on day 11 and the first 9 days were pure hell. I swear I never want to live thru it again so everyday I think of the hell to remind myself. The cravings are intense but so is my will. You can do this.",Future
"I'm going on 8 years in this hell. I want it behind me but I'm scared to wd. You put it perfectly though. Congrats on getting clean, don't look back.",Future
"Thank you. Yeah with pills we are always borrowing time from our future selves, in the beginning I thought I’d just have to go through a couple days of withdrawals...but PAWS is a bitch and so is the realization that you need to change your entire approach to life",Future
"So even after stopping for months, just a one time use brings it all back? I wanted to quit for a month or so to try and reset my body/brain lol. I'll miss them for sure but onto a better life it is.",Future
i feel better today maybe just needed 10 days to get over the mini withdrawal i was having that mentally gave me issues not 100% but better than iv been past few days,Present

"Congrats! I’ve just made it past 5 months and had a wonderful Christmas, I actually made a post about it on here. I’ve got a ways to go and can’t wait for me to hit a year. Really it’s a new lease on life for me and I couldn’t be more grateful, keep it up 💕",Future
I felt like kratom never fulfilled what I wanted. I could never sleep while on kratom neither. Even after being off opiates for a couple weeks,Past
I don’t want to be addicted to anything. Think I am just going to carry on the taper of tramadol. Doesn’t matter how long it takes.,Future

Its the devil 100%. At least on heroin i had euphoria. Fent is just pure oblivion. Which served its purposed when i was super depressed. You got this. Please please message me if you want to talk to someone. Anything ur going through in withdrawal ive probably been through.,Past

I’m almost 24 hours I’m not sick compared to last time maybe a little. I am usually very sick by now. One min at a time. I know I want to do it and stay clean. But my mind just says one more time. Worst disease ever.,Present
lmfao believe it or not this is my 4th (and hopefully last) time coming off of fent as well. hopefully it'll be over soon!,Future
Be happy...I’m on day one of no fet...took 35 mg of methadone hoping that’s enough for me to be comfortable I only have 100mg so I can’t waste it,Future
Okay i hope i dont get pwd thanks,Future

Yes. I’m miserable without drugs. I can stay sober for x amount of time but will always go back. 12 steps promising a spiritual experience and a new mindset and way of life. Drugs are but a symptom of our spiritual sickness.,Present

I know rehab works but who wants to just leave. If I had nothing to loose I would certainly go but I have bills to pay. Unfortunately,Future
So I find my cravings very few and far between now but it always helps to just play the whole situation out in my head. I remember that intense guilt and the feeling of never having enough drugs and never being satisfied and that just reminds me how grateful I am to be clean,Past

"I was addicted to pills, and that spiraled into ~800mg/day of oxy. The gatekeeping there can be insane. One thing: if you're that triggered, it's ok to walk out and take a breather. Have a cigarette if you smoke. You don't deserve to feel that way.",Past

I used pot for withdrawals and it worked wonders. Eventually though the curbed emotions get old. It's nice for a while. I def started to feel like I needed to smoke to even get out of bed. I think I used it for about 20 days.,Past

I will have a year sober from everything on 1/27. Which is tight.,Future
I took it and it made me feel like when I first got off the opiates. Sweats puking even more anxiety I throw the bottle away it was terrible,Past
That said I was a lazy self loathing piece of shit and I just started exercising around day 21 and these last few days going on long long walk/jogs that are helping  more then I can describe. I should have started earlier to tell you the truth.,Past

I felt the same way. My throat was extremely sore. I actually tested for covid (i was negative) My withdraws definitely mimicked the flu or covid. With covid being so bad in my area i definitely thought something was up. Keep pushing!!,Past
"I went almost 10 years of almost daily usage (technically 9.5 years.) It is doable. Have you done physical therapy for your chronic pain? That's literally what got me off of opiates and what keeps me off. 

It gets better, but only with time away.",Past

I think I might stay on the Neuro Regen for a bit though. It could help repair your brain and hopefully some neuroelasticity when trying to get back to a health life style for my mind (which for me is being active and working out).,Future

"I was on 170mg and had been for two years. The physical withdrawals lasted a little over a month, the mental stuff went away after about 3.",Past
I feel ya. The good news is that doing healthy stuff when you're sober (after you get through acute withdrawals) is actually fun again. And living your BEST life is totally worth the pain / work. You got this! Keep posting here and be honest with yourself!,Future
And the way i saw it was the 10s was what got me to the pressed 30s in the first place so theoretically should be able to get back down to 10s ( with some work and withdrawls still!) before i switch to kratom/suboxone,Past
Actually was thinking about using 10s for next 2-3 days and plan on withdrawaling while using but not too bad hopefully. Then after 2-3 days will use kratom to help with the WD symptoms. Use kratom for 2-3-4 weeks and hopefully get off of it,Future
Yup I'm still complaining after a year. Hmm at least it feels like a year. Lost count on day 7.,Past
"Yeah, that's why I suggested a ""day program"". I did mine outpatient and have done well. My point was more that you deserve a team of pros to help you, and that the help is available if you reach out.",Present
"Damn, 17 800mg pills a DAY?! Thats a heavy habit, well done getting through that. I'm only using 1 400mg pill, twice a day (so far). I'll definitely go a week maximum and hop off, the acute stage should be over by then.",Present
The gabapentin withdrawal SUCKS!!! I went through it and the RLS from that is HORRID. Be careful. Then again I was taking around 17 800mg pills and quit CT. Just be careful I even heard of people saying it pro long there WD symptoms. I wouldn't take it past a week.,Past
"Also. My triggers sre waking the fuck up and going to work. Opiates were my get up and go. 
Also doing anything social. I feel like I needed to do something to be able to go. I cant cope with life man.",Present
"Yeah I used to get this optimistic bigger than life feeling, I was just so happy and in such an amazing mood when I first started using, I absolutely loved it. But I don’t get it anymore. It was fun while it lasted but it’s time for me to quit",Past
I’ll also use trazadone so I don’t build a benzo addiction. So I can use which ever first. Getting sleep initially is very important since your body is freaking out,Future
Inspiring! Yeah I’m going to be using Xanax for the first night so I can really rest and let my body heal,Future
"I love this comment. Makes me feel very hopeful. Also you kickstarted me considering medical detox which hasn't truly been ""on the table"" in my mind really ever. Congratulations on 6 years",Future
I think so. It made mine way worse and gave me anxiety.  I took hylands restful legs pm . 8f it was really bad I wrapped ace bandages around my wrists and ankles. As tight as I could without cutting off circulation. Compression is good for rls.,Past
I obsessively listen to this video and have for a while. It really really speaks to me and I relate to so many things he says. I love Novak’s story as well as Stevo. So proud of them.,Present
I’ll keep that in mind. Last time I just did them two nights in a row and never touched them again,Future
Guilt mainly cause when I was about 30 days sober had someone very close to me OD on fent and had to give cpr didn’t have narcan had some like a week before and lost it. So mainly the guilt of dealing with that and depression from being an addict I guess,Past
"I’m on day 11 and things have only gotten worse by the day. Constant hot/cold sweats, stomach pains and diharhia. Sleeping 2-3 hours a night IF At all due to RLS. Don’t give up. There is light at the end of the tunnel. A nice warm bath and nutritious food&amp;lots of water!",Present
Morning and night were terrible didn’t sleep a minute .. took 3 baths and have severe rls.glad I’m in the hospital now.. may I ask what keeps you going ? Very proud of you !,Present
iMO yes. I had to use cbd instead if any weed or hash. I also made my anxiety worse unfortunately.,Past
Dude...warm showers. I remember my very first warm shower when I was completely through with acute withdrawal. It felt like the first shower I'd ever taken in my life.,Past
I’ve tried so many things for detox over the years. I personally think that gabapentin and weed pry work better than anything else at least for my symptoms. Clonidine works really good.,Present
"I don't even want to use to be honest. I mean ya sure it sounds fine I guess id do it, but I do NOT want to cycle again. The whole active opiate addiction circus gets so exhausting.",Present
I'm at the exact same place ive exhausted all resources nothing works anymore just xanax but I'm on probation so thats out the door.,Present
I hit a rut at 11 months too. I woke up one day and I was getting ready for work thinking to myself “this is it?” It’s been a few years since then and there’s not one second I regret pushing past that weirdness and staying sober. You’ll be ok!,Past
i’ve run out of reason to want to stay sober. i feel like i’d have more fun high,Present
I've probably come across as bashing it in the past: my experience was not enjoyable. But I'm definitely aware that it works well for plenty of folks.,Past
i’m barely surviving over her and i’m going on 11 months 😅,Present
"Thank you! Yeah, I had almost 3 years clean with one year 6 months on the shot and have never felt this before. Depression and addiction caught me :( . But at least I am here to get back on track! Thanks for responding!",Past
"It will be just don’t use any substance I learned I even abused weed if that makes sense, I would let it control me just like opiates. Because I have no self control",Future
"Sorry, should have been more clear. I had been off EVERYTHING for 8 days. Last 3 days of use were just the suboxone. I got the shot 3 days ago, so now I am 11 days off everything.",Present
Trazadone helps me I have never been able to sleep for 9-10 hours but with trazadone man shit has been knocking me out lately I take 100mg and 20min later it’s lights out. I hate relying on a sleeping pill but it’s the only way for me,Present
"I've only taken subs for a week, but I can imagine the wds are way worse if you stay on them for a while since bupe has such an incredibly long half life!",Present
Oh yeah. Definitely. I'm in my mid 30s. I'd always get a pink cloud when quitting. Last few quits I've just felt like crap,Present
"I get freezing cold but yet sweat my fucking ass off which in turn makes me colder it fucking sucks, I’m on day 14 and still get Cold asf sometimes.",Present
"Once I finished with acute withdrawals, I started sleeping better than I ever did on pills. Melatonin is a great OTC solution, as well as CBD.",Present
"I just overcame the shot lol. No fucking way was I going through Detox Part Two, at home, when I was supposed to be back at work. My ""tolerance"" on the shot was at least 4-fold higher, but I got the job done :)",Present
Nope 10 year oxycodone run. But they tested me and I was clean before the shot so I have no idea.,Past
I appreciate it a lot. Im 19 been addicted for about a year &amp; as for body fat im about as skinny and frail as it gets. Only 130 pounds too.,Present

Kratom gave me a yeast overgrowth and ruin my gut health. You have no idea what it's doing to your internal organs.,Past
I’m in the same boat. At work now on day 1. Just stay positive. It will pass. Hate this shit.,Present
