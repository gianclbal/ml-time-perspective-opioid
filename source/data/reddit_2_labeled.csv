Well, if you can afford it it's not so bad. I know of people who learned to live with their H dependency - working, consuming, and all. You have to be strict on yourself about not taking more than strictly necessary, otherwise tolerance builds too quickly.

Or you can quit it. That I've done and, while certainly a very shitty experience, it is no big deal. Physical withdrawal lasts about a week, the first three days are the worst part, then it gets easier.

c_derbz,"I actually failed out of university bc of it almost 10 years ago now and still suffer continual consequences to this day. Take it from me, get out of it while ya can bc this shit will eventually take away everything good from your life.",Mixed
lgncdi,"Long time booze hound opiate addict, that drank through withdrawals. In my experience it will not extend the opiate withdrawal symptoms, but you'll definitely feel way worse.",Present
MetaMetaFour523,"It was the last symptom to go when I detoxed. I sneezed for months. And now, three and a half years later I still never only sneeze once when I do happen to sneeze, it’s always sneezing fits now.",Mixed
gus_arschbackus,"Can only tell for myself.It didn't completely resetted my wd as i took a tiny amount of fent during detox, but it felt like i was throwed back one or two days.",Past
goodoldsaz,i know about it. just cant afford 9 days worth of fent. plus my girl uses too so thats double what i would need for 9 days of dope so we could both get off,Present
df118s,"TBH When I get clean I have so much energy, I feel well again and happy I don't have to worry about gear.

With a habit, I'll feel high for 6 hours, then sick again until I can redose.  Going through that every day sucks,  you can even sometimes get sick of the buzz.",Mixed
teamsleep,I used to feel exactly the same way and the only thing that helps is racking up more clean time. You’ll get less cravings and self destructive thoughts as time goes on. I only just started feeling “normal” at 100 days and now have about 240 days.,Mixed
coforbs,"Hell yeah, ur in the final stretch. I permanently fucked up my sneeze game, like i can never sneeze only once, it's always a total fit of em. Addiction, the gift that keeps on giving.ive been off em 2 years",Present
Nicksullivan67,True. If I can get rid of the restlessness I can get through the withdrawals.,Future
brandysnacker,"today i have 22 days clean. i did alllllll the laundry and painted my nails and cooked a meal. tomorrow i might organize my closet. i’ve also been trying to do a 20 min walk every day and yoga, though i really need to learn new poses.",Present
Only_Angst,No sweat my man....I never ever thought I would get clean but I did it and I don’t even think about opiates anymore,Present
Only_Angst,I recently got clean....I was OD’ing every week and enough was enough....got on suboxone and I’m getting my life back....,Mixed
popsmokeslover,98 days clean and My life is drastically better man! It’s crazy what being clean can help you accomplish,Present
thekingofsting6969,"If I relapse, how do I move past it, I’m so scared.",Present
brandysnacker,that is amazing. i can’t even tell my real sister because she’s very judgmental about opiates. i don’t blame her. her close friend od’d and died in her bathroom. it’s just a burden i can’t put on her. but i have a close friend who understands,Present
nightshadexw," wait 36-48 hours if not more! I thought I was fine after a day and a half, I was a heavy fent user like you, took my sub and got the WORST precipitated withdrawals of my life death was preferable! I felt I was gonna seize out just please wait it out 😔",Mixed
letsgooo828,Yes that's why I'm so frustrated with myself that I picked methadone of all things ... But I'm going to get through it. I have to  jd,Future
brandysnacker,"that’s amazing, congrats! this is the first time in like 10 years i can get my family presents as well. it’s not much, but still. feels fucking crazy.",Future
Remarkable-Ad3414,"I appreciate all the advice, thank you.

I will try to pull through without the benzos. Problem is I take care of a pregnant wife due in a month and two elderly parents, the withdrawals can’t interfere with my ability to function.",Future
facethestrain,"I understand you’re well intended, but this simply isn’t true. I’ve done a line of real H, and took 4 mg 6 hours later. No adverse effect. If the subs are in your system enough and you use a full agonist, you will not go into PWD.",Past
habibi0001,I think all addicts are. I think the reason we fall into drugs is partly because of that: we don't see a directive or a thing to get passionate about. People who recover usually always get into working out or some hobby.,Present
Many_Ad8950,"Honestly benzos would make me say screw it and relapse , just stay clean bro",Present
GrimButDim,And I wouldn't promise something that serious to my worst enemy if I thought there was even a chance you would get PWD.,Future
GrimButDim,You'll be alright. Been on subs ages. Just used one bag? Have a sleep. Then take it as normal the next day. You'll be fine. I do it all the time. The only time I get PWD is if I've been on a week binge. You had one bag for one day. You'll be fine. I promise.,Present
nothingrhymeswsierra,I’m normally on subutex and I’ve used grams and taken a subutex the next day and been fine. I just wanted to make sure I would’ve been good w suboxone bc I’m not familiar with it. I just switched,Present
XRMilk,I always found having a shower helped with the scalp itching. Codeine would always give me bad itching. Morphine itching I find rather pleasant.,Present
CrunchyMuffins4653,"16 mgs is quite a bit. Cut it now before it gets too bad, believe me. Taper for the next month or so and then use kratom for another 1-2 weeks and then jump off. Good luck.",Future
Syrian_lambchop,I have methadone though so I’m pretty numb 24/7 regardless.,Present
idkwhynot69420,Fent got rid of all my problems while using but then I regretted doing it and got hit with a brick of emotions when I quit worst idea I’ve ever had temporary relief was not worth it when I could have dealt with it and came to terms with my issues instead of prolonging Them,Past
OG-Corpse,"I had the same thing once in the states, a looong time ago. They're horribly stingy now. What'd they give out dilly syrup for?",Past
kan_u_feel_it,"Doing a little better, and yes they know of what brought me here. Thru just gave me some hydroxyzine and I'm bouta get discharged.",Present
Olmatehowyagoin,Strange I did 3 days in a row and stopped today have no withdrawals.,Present
OG-Corpse,"Gabapentin and tramadol worked wonders. The tramadol didn't reset the withdrawals at all for some reason, so it'll work with a T break",Present
CrunchyMuffins4653,Jesus I’m dealing with it now LOL was gonna write this same thing. Kind of annoying but only happens when I’m really out of it. Just kind of annoying I guess.,Present
OG-Corpse,"My pupils are so pinned... it's only for the holidays tho, opposite of what you're doing. Acid and weed will be amazing... you know psychedelics will help reset your addiction? Maybe it's a good time to stop and try something else this coming year",Present
Alyona_17432,I’m an hour past day 5 and just know THAT IT DOES GET BETTER. Cheers to a sober 2k21,Future
Tex-45,My gf has never figured out. Even when time when I get really dizzy and collapsed I talked my way out of it somehow. Y’all ever get that? Like spinners and you can’t stand up?,Past
fhbcas,"Thanks. Will definitely go and buy all of that! 
I can deal with the mental side effects, it’s the physical ones I guess I was more concerned with. Thank you thank you",Future
EquipmentProper,"Yes most ppl I’d imagine, bcos I’ve been addicted to DHC I’m lovely and motivated on it but also can go from empathic to snappy quite quickly at times",Past
TATP1982,"It's all good!  I used to frequent opiophile and blue light,  but under a way different username.. more of a lurker and I think I made maybe two or three posts? If that? I loved opioiphile..",Past
No-Dragonfruit609,I have been on MMT for 22 years and successfully have stayed clean from heroin and mexis for less time but awhile.,Present
DrBionicle176,"I honestly enjoyed it, it made getting the tattoo a more enjoyable experience since I was off oxy the entire 8 hours. I also used some pain numbing gel at the same time. Took like 80 mg over that time",Past
Haunting_Blueberry_5,Holy shit 5-8 a day that fent is unbelievable how fast your tolerance goes up. I’m just glad I realized before it got there. Literally the most I will ever do from now on is a half as a dose and try to make it smaller and smaller over the days. What do u think about that?,Present
Investigator_Alive,Ive been an addict mate and noone cares. All i cared about was my next hit.,Present
ahhhhskeetskeet,"L-to the-O-L.  Assuming I hit a nerve.  8 months of an addiction doesn’t mean a lifetime of addiction.  I appreciate the emotion behind your comments. You are coming from a true place, I believe that.",Future
Haunting_Blueberry_5,I see. I just have to constantly remind myself when I’m deep in wd that things will eventually get better. It’s such a strong mind game,Future
MrOverride,"Well I never keep one, I stop before I get too deep and I keep at least 10 days off before I start up with fent etc",Future
Haunting_Blueberry_5,Didn’t cop tbh plug gave it to me. I am sure I am ready bro trust me it’s just I was doing 2 a day bro so it’s harder than it sounds. And when you are drenched in sweat and can’t stop moving ur legs u know what I mean. I’ve never been thru this before,Present
tefKLONdon,No switching back to Kratom in the morning so I should be okay I think. Got a large dose set out waiting for me,Present
